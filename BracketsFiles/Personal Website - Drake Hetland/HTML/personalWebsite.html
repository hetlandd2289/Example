                As you could see from the title of the page, my name is Drake Hetland. I am majoring in the computer game design program.<br>
                I chose to study game design because video games are my biggest passion in life, so to be able to create them for a living would<br>
                be a dream come true for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like I said above, gaming is my passion, and therefore how I spend most of my time. I grew up on a Gameboy Advance and a PS2.<br>
                When I turned 13, I got an Xbox One for Christmas. Finally, last year, I built my first PC, and have begun transitioning to PC gaming.<br>
                Gaming isn't my only hobby though. I watch a lot of anime as well, and I also enjoy spending time with my two dogs.
