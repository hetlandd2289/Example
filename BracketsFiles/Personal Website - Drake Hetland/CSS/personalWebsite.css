Colors used: #02E0FF, #1E3234, #00FFAB, #0DAD79, #213931 I chose these colors because they are easy on the eye, and could be arranged
into a dark theme. They are also eye catching and interesting, all things that my target audience of young adults are interested in.
I also used #000 and #AAA on the art page to make the images and text there stand out from the background image.
Color scheme: Analogous. Art page differs because of the background image.
